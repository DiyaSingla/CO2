# CO2: Compute, Optimize, Offset is an AI-based carbon footprint calculator and recommendation app. The tagline highlights the key actions and goals of the app, i.e., to collect user data, such as the user's day-to-day activities, and compute the carbon footprints. Then it is analyzed using AI algorithms, provides real-time feedback on carbon emissions, and recommends actionable steps to offset emissions and personalized insights based on individual patterns and preferences. The app offers users the option to track their progress over time. It could provide insights into how changes in their lifestyle choices impact their carbon emissions, allowing users to see the positive effects of their sustainable actions. The app empowers users to make informed decisions, track their progress, and work towards reducing their carbon footprint for a more sustainable future.

# To better understand what people know about Carbon footprints, what are their daily means of transport to the university, how aware they are, how willing they are, etc., I surveyed the students of my university using a Google form. The data so obtained has been visualized in Python.
